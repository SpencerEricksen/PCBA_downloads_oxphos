RESULT_DESCR,,,,,,,PubChem standardized value transformed from 'Standard Value'. The unit is always micromolar,Standardized activity type (e.g. IC50 rather than Ic-50/Ic50/ic50/ic-50),"Qualifier (e.g. >, <, =) for 'Standard Value'",Standardized activity value transformed to common units: e.g. mM concentrations converted to nM,Selected units for 'Standard Type': e.g. concentrations are in nM,Additional comments
