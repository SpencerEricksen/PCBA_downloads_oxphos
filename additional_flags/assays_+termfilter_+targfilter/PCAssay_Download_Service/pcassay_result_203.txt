68. Inhibition Assay: Beef heart mitochondria were obtained by a large-scale procedure. Inverted submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared by the method of Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (J. Biol. Chem. 260 (1985), p. 14424), and stored in a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at  inverted question mark80 degrees  C. Inhibitory effects of compounds on bovine heart mitochondrial complex (I, III, IV) were evaluated. Maximal dimethyl sulfoxide concentration never exceeded 2% and had no influence on the control enzymatic activity. Beef heart SMP were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL. The enzymatic activities were assayed at 30 degrees  C. and monitored spectrophotometrically with a Beckman Coulter DU-530 (340 nm, c=6.22 mM inverted question mark1 cm inverted question mark1). NADH oxidase activity was determined in a reaction medium (2.5 mL) containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM MgCl2. The final mitochondrial protein concentration was 30  inverted question markg.
